# Project Title
SNK Hall Voice: Hall Complaint Management for Student Satisfaction
# Project Description
This is a HALL-based project where students can submit complaints, which are sent to the hall admin. The admin then marks the complaint as 'in process.' Students can provide feedback on whether they are satisfied or not, and based on their reviews, a graph will be generated. Additionally, the admin can make announcements, which will be visible to the users.
