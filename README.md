# Project Title
SNK Hall Voice: Hall Complaint Management for Student Satisfaction
# Project Description
This is a HALL-based project where students can submit complaints, which are sent to the hall admin. The admin then marks the complaint as 'in process.' Students can provide feedback on whether they are satisfied or not, and based on their reviews, a graph will be generated. Additionally, the admin can make announcements, which will be visible to the users.

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- **CSS**: For styling and designing the user interface.
- **Bootstrap**: A front-end framework for building responsive, mobile-first websites.
- **JavaScript**: Used to add interactivity and logic to the application.
- **React Router**: Used for enabling client-side routing within the web application.
## Backend Technologies Used

The backend of this project is developed with the following technologies:

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- **Express**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store user and complaint data.
- **bcrypt**: A library to hash passwords for security purposes.
- **Nodemon**: A tool that helps in automatically restarting the server when file changes are detected during development.
